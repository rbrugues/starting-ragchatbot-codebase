# Frontend Changes Summary

## Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

This feature implementation focused on enhancing the backend testing framework for the RAG system, which indirectly supports frontend functionality by ensuring API reliability.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added pytest configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
- Added `httpx>=0.24.0` and `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0` dependencies for API testing
- Configured pytest with proper test discovery settings
- Added test markers for organization (slow, integration, api)
- Set asyncio mode to "auto" for async test support

#### 2. Created test fixtures (`backend/tests/conftest.py`)
- **Mock fixtures**: Comprehensive mocking for all RAG system components
- **Data fixtures**: Sample course data, chunks, API requests/responses
- **Environment fixtures**: Temporary directories, test configuration
- **Common fixtures**: Anthropic client mocking, vector store mocking

#### 3. Implemented API endpoint tests (`backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- **Root endpoint testing**: Tests for `/` endpoint basic functionality
- **Query endpoint testing**: Comprehensive tests for `/api/query` including:
  - Successful query processing
  - Session ID handling (creation and persistence)
  - Request validation and error handling
  - Complex source object handling
  - Empty results scenarios
- **Courses endpoint testing**: Tests for `/api/courses` including:
  - Course statistics retrieval
  - Error handling
  - Empty course scenarios
- **Integration tests**: Multi-endpoint consistency and session persistence

#### 4. Solved static file mounting issue
- Created a separate test app factory that excludes static file mounting
- Prevents import errors in test environment where frontend files don't exist
- Maintains all API functionality while avoiding filesystem dependencies

### Testing Results
- **12 new API endpoint tests** - All passing âœ…
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all three main API endpoints
- **Robust error handling** testing for edge cases
- **Integration testing** for multi-endpoint workflows

### Frontend Impact
While this was primarily a backend testing enhancement, it provides:
- **API reliability assurance** for frontend integration
- **Comprehensive error scenario testing** that frontend can rely on
- **Session management verification** for stateful frontend interactions
- **Response format validation** ensuring consistent data structures for frontend consumption

### Files Modified/Created
- `pyproject.toml` - Added testing dependencies and pytest configuration
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` - New shared fixtures and test utilities
- `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` - New comprehensive API tests

The enhanced testing framework ensures the API endpoints that the frontend depends on are thoroughly tested and reliable, supporting robust frontend functionality.
